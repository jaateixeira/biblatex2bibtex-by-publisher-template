From a collection of .bib files (compatible with BibLaTeX/Biber), create a single .bib file (compatible with BibTeX) for a given Latex template provided by a publisher. 

As BibLaTeX/Biber is superior to BibTex, but most well-known publishers do not support it yet, we aim to speed up the publication of working papers in LaTeX in journals from publishers or archivers that are slow to adopt or support BibLaTeX. 


Supported LaTeX templates: 
- 'non-strict'
- 'Wiley-NJDv5'
- 'Wiley-book'
- 'Springer-sn-jnl'
- 'Springer-LNCS'
- 'IEEE-tran'
- 'ACM-acmart'
- 'Elsevier-elsarticle'
- 'Sage-sagej'
